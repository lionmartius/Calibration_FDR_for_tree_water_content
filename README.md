## Towards accurate monitoring of water content in woody tissue across tropical forests and other biomes

1.	Forest ecosystems face increasing drought exposure due to climate change, necessitating accurate measurements of vegetation water content to assess drought stress and tree mortality risks. While Frequency Domain Reflectometry (FDR) offers a viable method for monitoring stem water content using dielectric permittivity, challenges arise from uncertainties in sensor calibration linked to wood properties and species variability, impeding its wider usage.
2.	We sampled tropical forest trees and palms in the eastern Amazon, to evaluate how FDR output differences are controlled by wood density, temperature and taxonomic identity. Water content was estimated gravimetrically for each segment using a temporally explicit wet-up/dry-down approach, and the relationship with dielectric permittivity was examined.
3.	We established the first linear tropical tree and palm calibration equation (TTCM) that performed well for estimating absolute water content values. Notably, we demonstrated that calibration sensitivity remained consistent across species, enabling the creation of a simplified one-slope model (OSM) for accurate, species-independent measurements of relative water content. 
4.	Our OSM serves as the first universally applicable and species-independent calibration for assessing relative water content in woody tissue using FDR technology, offering a valuable tool for quantifying drought responses and stress in trees and forest ecosystems.   ðŸŒ´
